##Concept
BLU Team are still Mann mercenaries (No change).

RED Team play as Female equivalent of their current class.

###Prerequisites
- [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/)
- [TF2 Model Manager](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=164630)

###Installation
Extract the Zip in your server directory and restart it.

##What works
- Players models for Scout, Medic, Heavy, Spy, Sniper and Engineer.
- Voicelines replacement.
- Classic gamemodes (Payload, CTF, Arena...).

##What does not work
- Sometime some voicelines doesn't play correctly.
- Some models are missing (Soldier and Demoman) because they simply does not exist. So the models stay the same.

##Incompatibility
The mod should logically not work if you use any model management/replacing function for the Red Team.

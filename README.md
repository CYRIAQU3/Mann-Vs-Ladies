# Mann VS Ladies
A Team Fortress 2 Server Mod for playing as a Female Mercenary.

##Concept
BLU Team are still Mann mercenaries (No change).

RED Team play as Female equivalent of their current class.

###Prerequisites
- Sourcemod

###Instalation
Extract the Zip in your server directory and restart it.

##What works
- Players models for Scout, Medic, Heavy, Spy, Sniper and Engineer.
- Voicelines replacement.
- Classic gamemodes (Payload, CTF, Arena...).

##What does not work
- Sometime some voicelines doesn't play correctly.
- Some models are missing (Soldier and Demoman) because they simply does not exist. So the models stay the same.
